# House_Insurance_Calc

My first project with kotlin/android studio/xml
Used tutorials and other outside materials to learn the basics of android studio
This app asks for the user to give the price of a house and then gives the user their monthly mortgage payment based on the bank interest rate they select

Willl later develop the user interface of this app and also add a page that allows for the calculation of monthly car payments given the correct information.
